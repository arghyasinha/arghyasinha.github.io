I am a [Prime Minister Research Fellow (PMRF)](https://www.pmrf.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/), currently engaged in the [Lab of Imaging Sciences (LISA)](https://sites.google.com/site/kunalnchaudhury/group) within the *Department of Electrical Engineering, IISc*, under the guidance of [Prof. Kunal Narayan Chaudhury](https://sites.google.com/site/kunalnchaudhury/home).  

My primary research is on **convex and nonconvex optimization** for the development of **novel algorithms** that help in improved **image reconstruction**. We use **supervised learning** as well as **classical frameworks** to design **data-driven priors** for regularization in a large class of inverse problem frameworks such as superresolution and deblurring. We establish convergence guarantees for various algorithms using optimization and algebraic approach to obtain stable and high-quality reconstructions.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in **topology and topological data analysis**. For my master's project at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), I explored **embeddings of graphs on higher-dimensional manifolds**, under the supervision of [Prof. Bidyut Sanki](https://sites.google.com/view/homebidyut-iitk/home).
