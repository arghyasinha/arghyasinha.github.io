I am a [Prime Minister Research Fellow (PMRF)](https://www.pmrf.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/), currently engaged in the [Lab of Imaging Sciences (LISA)](https://sites.google.com/site/kunalnchaudhury/group) within the *Department of Electrical Engineering, IISC*, under the guidance of [Prof. Kunal Narayan Chaudhury](https://sites.google.com/site/kunalnchaudhury/home). My primary research centers on investigating various image reconstruction techniques applicable to areas such as superresolution and deblurring. This work involves establishing convergence guarantees through both convex and non-convex optimization methods, developing and training deep learning-based denoisers for image reconstruction, and creating accelerated algorithms to enhance performance.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in topology and topological data analysis. For my master's project at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), I explored the embeddings of graphs on higher-dimensional manifolds, under the supervision of [Prof. Bidyut Sanki](https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/bidyut-sanki).
